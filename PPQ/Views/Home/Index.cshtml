        <p>Before beginning this questionnaire, please acknowledge your understanding that SexInfo Online cannot diagnose any medical conditions, including pregnancy.</p>
        
        <p>The following questionnaire will ask you to respond to detailed questions about your sexual experience concerning male ejaculation, your menstrual cycle, and contraceptive use. Following the inquiry, we will provide you with a response that estimates your probability of pregnancy. The questions may not address your precise situation, but they were designed to encompass the experiences typical of many SexInfo Online readers. Please do your best to choose the answer that most accurately reflects your experience.</p>
        
        <p>If you feel the questionnaire did not provide answer choices that accurately reflected your experience or have any other suggestions, please feel free to leave us constructive feedback through the “Ask the Sexperts” submission page!</p>
